  "introduction": "Welcome to Physics Laboratory - 1, a virtual platform designed to help students explore fundamental physics experiments through interactive simulations. This lab allows students to gain a clear understanding of concepts and experimental techniques before performing them in a physical laboratory. Covering a range of topics such as oscillations, electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, and quantum effects, the lab includes experiments like the Monostable and Bistable Multivibrator, Hall Effect, Zeeman Effect, Double Pendulum, and Kerr Effect. By engaging with these simulations, students can enhance their learning experience and develop confidence in conducting real-world experiments.",
